#Architecture Overview
###Translation Integration Service
The Translation Integration Service is the core service responsible for interacting with external translation providers, specifically the Google Translation API.
It acts as a middleware that manages the connection, handles requests, and processes responses from the Google Translation API.
This service abstracts the complexities of dealing with the API directly and provides a consistent interface for other services in the system.

###Translation gRPC Service
The Translation gRPC Service leverages the Translation Integration Service to provide translation functionalities via the gRPC protocol. 
gRPC, which stands for Remote Procedure Call, allows this service to efficiently handle streaming data and requests in a distributed environment. 
This service is designed to facilitate fast and reliable communication between different components of your system,
making it suitable for high-performance scenarios where low latency and high throughput are crucial.

###Translation Web API
The Translation Web API also utilizes the Translation Integration Service but serves its functionality over the more traditional HTTP protocol. 
This service is intended for web-based applications and other clients that interact with RESTful APIs. By using HTTP, 
this service ensures broad compatibility and accessibility, allowing various client applications to request translations using simple HTTP methods like GET and POST.

###Clients
The Clients directory contains various client applications designed to interact with the services provided by the architecture.
These clients may connect to either the Translation gRPC Service or the Translation Web API depending on the protocol and use case. 
The clients are responsible for sending requests to the services and handling the responses, enabling seamless integration into different environments, 
whether it's a desktop application, mobile app, or another type of system.
